Configure NETWORK - Debian
        
        
First of all we need to find the correct network device.
The command netstat -i will do the trick

rtm@debian:~$ netstat -i
Kernel Interface table
Iface MTU Met RX-OK RX-ERR RX-DRP RX-OVR TX-OK TX-ERR TX-DRP TX-OVR Flg
eth0 1500 0 476 0 0 0 187 0 0 0 BMRU
lo 65536 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 LRU

In my case is eth0

So lets edit the configuration file. Remember you need to be root to do it !
The file is located here

vi /etc/network/interfaces

From now on we have two paths to follow, dhcp or static ! I will show how configure both

==DHCP==
Add these lines

        auto eth0
        allow-hotplug eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp
        
Then restart the interface
root@debian:~# /etc/init.d/networking restart
[ ok ] Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.
And its done!

==STATIC==
This require a little more will ! Edit the file and add the following lines according to your scenario

        auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.0.21 
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.0.1
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8


Then restart the interface

root@debian:~# /etc/init.d/networking restart
[ ok ] Restarting networking (via systemctl): networking.service.

And its done!
Everything must be working at this time !
