Configure NETWORK via cli – CENTOS 7
                 
First of all we need to find the correct network device.
The command nmcli d will do the trick

rtm@centos:~$ nmcli d
DEVICE TYPE STATE CONNECTION
enp0s3 ethernet disconnected enp0s3
lo loopback unmanaged —

In my case is enp0s3
So lets edit the configuration file. Remember you need to be root to do it !
The file is located here
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
And have the following content

  TYPE=Ethernet
  BOOTPROTO=none
  DEFROUTE=yes
  PEERDNS=yes
  PEERROUTES=yes
  IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
  IPV6INIT=yes
  IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes
  IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
  IPV6_PEERDNS=yes
  IPV6_PEERROUTES=yes
  IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
  NAME=enp0s3
  UUID=828a0fb1-f5c7-4657-bfb6-5c939d888014
  DEVICE=enp0s3
  ONBOOT=no


From now on we have two paths to follow, dhcp or static ! I will show how configure both 

==DHCP==

Its the easier way ! just edit the two marked lines

  BOOTPROTO=none
  ONBOOT=no
to
  BOOTPROTO=dhcp
  ONBOOT=yes

Then restart the network interface
[root@localhost ~]# /etc/init.d/network restart
Restarting network (via systemctl): [ OK ]
 
==Static==

This require a little more will ! Edit the file …

  BOOTPROTO=none
  ONBOOT=no
to
  BOOTPROTO=static
  ONBOOT=yes

But you will need add some config lines !

  IPADDR=192.168.0.16
  NETMASK=255.255.255.0
  GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
  DNS1=8.8.8.8

Then restart the network interface
[root@localhost ~]# /etc/init.d/network restart
Restarting network (via systemctl): [ OK ]

Everything must be working at this time !
