Document - Commands for SSH Agent Forwarding
Step 1: Create Public/Private Key in Remote Client EC2

ssh-keygen

Step 2: Setup Authentication

Copy the contents of public key form remote-client to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file of both Bastion and Private EC2.

Step 3: Use SSH Agent Forwarding

Run the following commands on the remote-client EC2 instance

exec ssh-agent bash
eval 'ssh-agent -s'
ssh-add -L
ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Step 4: Test the Setup

From remote-client EC2, run the following command:

ssh -A [BASTION-EC2-IP]

Once you are logged into Bastion, try to connect to Private EC2

ssh [IP-OF-PRIVATE-EC2]
